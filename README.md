This repository is for the case study currently planned as part of the submission for FM 2024

The repository contains a dockerfile and a devcontainer.json, that create a minimal virtual machine containing (for the moment) mcrl2. In the repository, there is a directory containing a very simple example on which Mieke has been working on.
